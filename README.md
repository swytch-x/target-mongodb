# target-mongodb

`target-mongodb` is a Singer target for MongoDB.

Build with the [Meltano Target SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com).

## Installation

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` Update the below as needed to correctly describe the install procedure. For instance, if you do not have a PyPi repo, or if you want users to directly install from your git repo, you can modify this step as appropriate.

```bash
pipx install target-mongodb
```

## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` Provide a list of config options accepted by the target.

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
target is available by running:

```bash
target-mongodb --about
```

### Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` If your target requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.

## Usage

You can easily run `target-mongodb` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](www.meltano.com).

### Executing the Target Directly

```bash
target-mongodb --version
target-mongodb --help
# Test using the "Carbon Intensity" sample:
tap-carbon-intensity | target-mongodb --config /path/to/target-mongodb-config.json
```

## Developer Resources

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` As a first step, scan the entire project for the text "`TODO:`" and complete any recommended steps, deleting the "TODO" references once completed.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `target_mongodb/tests` subfolder and
then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `target-mongodb` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run target-mongodb --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](meltano.com)

_**Note:** This target will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd target-mongodb
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke target-mongodb --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline with the Carbon Intensity sample tap:
meltano elt tap-carbon-intensity target-mongodb
```

### SDK Dev Guide

See the [dev guide](../../docs/dev_guide.md) for more instructions on how to use the Meltano SDK to
develop your own Singer taps and targets.
